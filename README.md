# SCIB_Canon Repository

Welcome to the official canon repository for **She Came In Blood (SCIB)** â€” second draft system, character arcs, symbolism, ritual logic, and prose evolution.

This GitHub vault is structured to mirror the full Glitchborn Master Canon and enable seamless tracking, editing, and continuity verification across all layers of the narrative.
