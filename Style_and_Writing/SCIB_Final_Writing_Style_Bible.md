# 🩸 *She Came In Blood*
## Final Writing Style Bible

### I. CORE NARRATIVE VOICE — *Empowered Splatterpunk Pulp*

A visceral, cinematic fusion of gritty pulp, erotic empowerment, explicit 1970s sleaze, mythic symbolism, and Splatterpunk horror.

- **Short, Sharp Sentences**: Lean prose. Every word must ache.
- **Explicit yet Poetic**: Sex and violence rendered in sacred imagery.
- **Mythic Undertow**: Symbols evolve. Language bleeds. Ritual drives the structure.
- **Pulp Realism**: 1977 NYC decay. Mildew, lipstick, cum, blood, broken neon.

### II. LITERARY & CINEMATIC DNA

- **Russ Meyer**: Empowered sex, hyperreal women
- **Splatterpunk (Craig/Spector)**: Carnage with character consequence
- **Anaïs Nin / Kathy Acker**: Erotic language with psychic and emotional weight
- **1970s Pulp & Exploitation**: Noir pacing, tight dialogue, sleaze as truth
- **Twin Peaks / Cronenberg**: Emotional surrealism and psychic leakage

### III. SENTENCE STRUCTURE & RHYTHM SYSTEMS

- **Fragments = trauma echoes**
- **Italics = psychic bleed**
- **Em dashes = emotional rupture**

### IV. CHARACTER VOICE + DIALOGUE MODULES

### V. SEX, VIOLENCE & RITUAL SCENE STRUCTURE

**Ritual Arc**:  
*Initiation → Invocation → Climax (Sex or Kill) → Reflection / Echo*

**Fluid Theology**:

### ✚ FINAL NOTE

> *If it doesn’t bleed, cut it.  
If it hesitates, sharpen it.  
If it lies, break it open.*

**This is your ritual text. Your style gospel. Your psalm of the fucked and the forgotten.**
