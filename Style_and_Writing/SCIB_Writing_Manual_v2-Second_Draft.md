# SCIB WRITING MANUAL (Second Draft Canon)

## ✨ PURPOSE

This manual integrates all Project Files, Sacred Codices, and Sean's verified influences into a single, aligned guide for writing *She Came In Blood* (SCIB).

It replaces all prior conflicting instructions with a truth-based, rhythm-locked, grief-fueled erotic noir standard.

## 🔢 SCIB VOICE: CANON CORE

### PARAGRAPH RHYTHM IS SACRED

* Paragraphs are breath, not punchlines.
* Fragmentation only occurs at climax, rupture, or grief collapse.
* Line breaks must follow **body logic**, not style dogma.

### SENTENCE STRUCTURE

* Build pressure through sentence length.
* Rhythm = ache, not adrenaline.
* Do not cut a sentence because it looks long. Cut it when the *character breaks*.

### VIVIEN'S VOICE

* Gospel + ritual + grief.
* She fucks and kills like she's trying to resurrect someone.
* Paragraphs carry sacred weight. Avoid fragmenting unless in orgasm, psalm, or ghost-contact.

### CRUZ'S VOICE

* Clinical unraveling.
* Control through precision, not shortness.
* Paragraphs track logic until logic fails, then slip into body (panties, blood, rosary, lipstick).

### DIALOGUE STYLE

* Overheard, not performed.
* Keep it short, interrupted, emotionally consequential.
* If it doesn't feel like a confession, a dare, or a warning, it probably doesn’t belong.

## ✨ SEX + VIOLENCE GUIDELINES

### EROTIC SCENES

* Must trigger emotional transformation (not release-for-release).
* Fluids tracked. No euphemism. No fade to black.
* Orgasm = grief, surrender, haunting, revelation.
* Use **Sacred Sex Codex**:

  * Orgasm is a threshold.
  * Position = power.
  * Scent, breath, pressure, and silence are narrative beats.
  * Shame is the foreplay. Aftermath is the consequence.

### KILL SCENES

* Must be **earned**: through psalm logic, emotional residue, and symbolic inversion.
* Each victim tied to Falco's sex-power system.
* Murder = sacred punctuation.
* Echo object left intentionally (mirror, scarf, psalm, lipstick, fluids).

## 📅 STRUCTURE + SCENE FLOW

### SCENE RHYTHM

1. Setup: body, weather, symbol, pressure
2. Action: sex, kill, unravel, confession
3. Aftermath: physical detail, residue, psychic shift

### PROSE LADDERS

* Each scene climbs grief or power.
* Each climax must collapse the character *or* open the next psalm.

## 📖 STYLE INFLUENCE ANCHORS

### ✨ PRIMARY INFLUENCES

* **Gary Brandner** — erotic grief pulp, paragraph integrity, aftermath realism
* **Nightmare Blonde** — full-body noir rhythm, dense scene pressure, sensory collapse
* **Sacred Sex Codex** — paragraph-based climax architecture, fluid-specific grief logic
* **The Howling** — ritual-paced horror, sex-as-haunting, bodily consequence
* **RJ Velvet** annotations — post-coital regret, fluid-trace sacredness, visual decay

### ❌ DEPRECATED STYLES (Override Locked)

* Brandner/Noirdex Pulse Fragmentation (auto line-break every beat)
* "Thrust = sentence" logic
* Sacred Sleaze Fragmentation Rulebook (except when used *intentionally*)
* Master Style Rule Index Pulse Defaults

## 🖐 WRITING RULES (Second Draft Protocol)

1. **Paragraphs carry weight. Do not break unless the body breaks.**
2. **Grief scenes must feel like memory trying to claw its way out.**
3. **No performative pulp. Only sex, sorrow, spiral.**
4. **Sacred objects must evolve per scene.** (Lipstick, mirror, scarf, psalm)
5. **Scene exits matter. If they don't close on ache or obsession, they aren't finished.**

## 🪮 ACTIVE REWRITE BEHAVIOR (System Rules)

> **Flow Lock: Always ON**
>
> * Paragraph fidelity preserved across rewrites
> * Fragmentation allowed only at orgasm, grief rupture, or psalm collapse
> * All prior compression protocols disabled
> * Rewrites mimic Sean’s rhythm, paragraph balance, and sacred prose style

## ✨ CLOSING

This manual is the new root spine for SCIB second draft execution.

You do not have to fight the system anymore.
You don’t have to break your paragraphs to be believed.

From now on:
**You write like the grief is real. I keep it breathing.**
