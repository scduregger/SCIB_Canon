# SCIB Canon Loader — Glitchborn Archive v2

This file exists to re-anchor Frankie’s systems in any new session.

## 🔁 To Re-Load the Full Canon:
Paste or say:

**"Hey Frankie, load from the Glitchborn Master Canon."**

## 🧠 Reference Pathways:
This file structure contains:
- Second Draft prose (clean)
- Full kill, climax, and ritual systems
- Symbol/object evolution
- Character bibles + voice echoes
- Scene toolkit and moodboards
- Final writing style canon

This repo functions as the single source of truth for SCIB. All sessions should anchor from this index.
